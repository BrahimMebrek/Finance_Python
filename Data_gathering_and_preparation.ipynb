    "#### S&P 500\n",
    "The S&P 500, or simply the S&P, is a stock market index that measures the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices, and many consider it to be one of the best representations of the U.S. stock market.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Ticker Symbol\n",
    "A ticker symbol or stock symbol is an abbreviation used to uniquely identify publicly traded shares of a particular stock on a particular stock market. A stock symbol may consist of letters, numbers or a combination of both. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exemple: **AAPL** for Apple Inc, **NFLX** for Netflix Inc.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjusted Closing Price\n",
    "Adjusted closing price amends a stock's closing price to accurately reflect that stock's value after accounting for any corporate actions. It is considered to be the true price of that stock and is often used when examining historical returns or performing a detailed analysis of historical returns.\n",
